### Yeah, I have to make this about me.
My name is **Soumik Ranjan Dasgupta**. You can call me Arjo, too. Here are some fun facts about me:

- I prefer snake_cases over CamelCases.
- My most productive days are Wednesdays.
- I prefer tabs over spaces (honestly, who doesn't?).
- I'm not a robot.

### What have I done?

Currently, I am placed as an Associate Software Engineer at [RBEI](https://www.bosch.in/). Previously, I have collaborated with [ThetaOne Labs](http://thetaonelab.com/) and [VIR Softech](https://www.virsoftech.com/) to provide deep-learning based solutions. As for academics, I am a graduate in Computer Science and Engineering from [Jalpaiguri Government Engineering College](https://jgec.ac.in).

### What else?

One of the key aspects I believe in is growing together. Apart from that, I am an avid bibliophile who is recently heavily inclined towards mythological and science fictions. I tend to write stories, make memes and do digital illustrations in my free time. Also, I love puns!

### Tea together, sometime?
