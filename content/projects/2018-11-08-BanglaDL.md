A real-time system that classifies handwritten single Bengali characters. Implementation of Handwritten Bangla Digit Recognition using Deep Learning by Md Zahangir Alom et. al. Uses basic convolutional architecture. Achieved an average training and testing accuracy of around 85%. Done using the  [CMATERdb](https://www.dropbox.com/s/55bhfr3ycvsewsi/CMATERdb%203.1.2.rar){:target="_blank"} pattern recognition database.
Here is a snapshot of what the output looks like:
