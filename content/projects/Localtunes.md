A pretty simple web application that lets you download songs to a particular directory, and uses the inbuilt functionality of your browser to play multiple codecs to play songs. I came up with this because I couldn't find any music player for my device that would behave the way I want, and of course I had nothing more important to do at the time.  
This uses `flask` to run the app from localhost. You download the music files you want to play to a particular directory (`static/music`) and run the `main.py` to start. You'd be able to see the result in 
`localhost:5000`.
