A browser based OCR engine working with a python wrapper of [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki) in the backend. The 
front end is rendered using Flask. The latest version of Tesseract is at 
play here and it gives surprisingly good outputs with a few preprocessing 
steps. It's still a work in progress -- I haven't yet figured out why my 
trained files get automatically deleted from the server save the default one
([view the detailed question in stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/q/53096796/8507120).)  


Once I figure that out, I'll add more language supports and choices of preprocessing.
