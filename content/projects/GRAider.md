This is a Tkinter-based tool that I used to download the results of the students in batch.  
I named it GRAider - an aider to download grade cards - geddit? :D  
Given the values in the GUI, the tool lets you download the results in batches. There are a few instances where the roll numbers are invalid, so the result is an unreadable PDF. I intend to work on it soon, however, if you want to contribute, feel free to create a pull request [here](https://github.com/srdg/graider).
