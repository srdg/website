A pretty simple web application that lets you download songs to a particular directory, and uses the inbuilt functionality of your browser to play multiple codecs to play songs. I came up with this because I couldn't find any music player for my device that would behave the way I want, and of course I had nothing important to do at the time. Uses flask to run the app from localhost.
